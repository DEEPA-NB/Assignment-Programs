HALLOW RECTANGLE

I have written this java program to create a hallow rectanlge and written a name inside it.

First i have written a code to enter the name from the user side using Scanner class.

 System.out.println("Enter name");
  String name=sc.next();
  
  And the code to enter the rows and columns is
  
   System.out.println("Enter rows");
  int r =sc.nextInt();
  System.out.println("Enter columns");
  int c=sc.nextInt();
  int a=name.length();
